# Niche

Niche is a social media platform that brings back a highly customizable 
platform while keeping friends close and information easy to access.

## How It Works

Niche allows the user to fully customize their profile page while keeping it simple
and safe. Like the former MySpace, users can add multiple types of components to
their profiles from text, images, songs, and videos to truly show their personality and
interests. 

Niche also allows users to create multiple feeds with certain constraits
so that users can seperate out their interests. Constraints could consist of certain
people, words, or hashtags.
